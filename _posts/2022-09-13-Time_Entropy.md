**Information --> measurement of causal relationship?**  

**Information --> entropy**  

**Low entropy --> low causal relationship --> fundamental physical law (it's time reversible, or TIME SYMMETRY!!!)**

**High entropy --> high information -> high causal relationship (time irreversible, or break TIME SYMMETRY!!) --> daily life.**

**Time direction --> entropy from low to high --> entropy 就是 information (low to high) --> causal relationship  (from low to high)**
