## Introduction





####  Prompt 1

```
I want to create a keyboard input program to predict the next word.  I want this program to connect GPT-3 API.  Generate for me a step-by-step guide.
```



#### Generative result 1

Sure, I can help you create a keyboard input program to predict the next word using the GPT-3 API. Here's a step-by-step guide to get started:

**Step 1: Set up your GPT-3 API account To use the GPT-3 API**, you will need to sign up for an account on the OpenAI website and obtain an API key. Follow the instructions on the OpenAI website to create an account and generate an API key.

**Step 2: Install necessary packages** You will need to install the following Python packages to work with the GPT-3 API:

- openai
- keyboard

You can install these packages using pip by running the following command in your terminal:

```shell
pip install openai keyboard
```

Step 3: Set up your Python script Open your preferred text editor and create a new Python script. You will need to import the openai and keyboard modules, as well as set up your API key.

```python
python import openai
import keyboard

openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Step 4: Create a function to predict the next word You can use the `openai.Completion.create()` function to generate predictions for the next word based on the user's input. Here's an example function that takes in the user's input and returns a prediction for the next word:

```python
python def predict_next_word(input_text):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-002",
        prompt=input_text,
        max_tokens=1,
        n=1,
        stop=None,
        temperature=0.5,
    )
    prediction = response.choices[0].text.strip()
    return prediction
```

In this example, we're using the `text-davinci-002` engine, which is the most capable GPT-3 model available. You can adjust the `max_tokens` parameter to change the length of the prediction, and the `temperature` parameter to control the "creativity" of the prediction.

Step 5: Set up a keyboard listener You can use the `keyboard` module to listen for keyboard input from the user. Here's an example function that listens for the user to press the spacebar, then calls the `predict_next_word()` function with the user's input:

```python
python def on_spacebar(event):
    input_text = keyboard.get_typed_strings(event)[0]
    prediction = predict_next_word(input_text)
    print(prediction)

keyboard.on_press_key("space", on_spacebar)
```

In this example, we're using the `on_press_key()` function to listen for the spacebar key. When the user presses the spacebar, the `on_spacebar()` function is called, which gets the user's input using the `get_typed_strings()` function and passes it to the `predict_next_word()` function. Finally, the prediction is printed to the console.

Step 6: Run your script Save your Python script and run it from the terminal. When you press the spacebar, the program will generate a prediction for the next word based on your input.

That's it! With these steps, you should now have a keyboard input program that predicts the next word using the GPT-3 API.



#### Prompt 2

```
Excellent!  Can you provide 5 possible next words instead of 1?
```



#### Generative result 2

Sure! To generate multiple possible next words instead of just one, you can adjust the `n` parameter in the `openai.Completion.create()` function to the number of predictions you want to generate. Here's an updated version of the `predict_next_word()` function that returns 5 possible next words:

```python
python def predict_next_words(input_text):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-002",
        prompt=input_text,
        max_tokens=1,
        n=5,
        stop=None,
        temperature=0.5,
    )
    predictions = [choice.text.strip() for choice in response.choices]
    return predictions
```

In this example, we're setting the `n` parameter to 5 to generate 5 possible predictions. The `predict_next_words()` function now returns a list of 5 possible next words, which you can use however you like.

To print out the 5 possible next words, you can modify the `on_spacebar()` function to loop through the predictions and print each one:

```python
python def on_spacebar(event):
    input_text = keyboard.get_typed_strings(event)[0]
    predictions = predict_next_words(input_text)
    for prediction in predictions:
        print(prediction)
```

Now, when you press the spacebar, the program will generate and print out 5 possible next words based on your input.
